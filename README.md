# GuessMyNumber

Guess a number between 1 and 20 by inputting your guess into the field and clicking the "Check!" button.

If your guess is too high or too low, your score for this round will decrease.

When you guess the number correctly, the number is revealed and the background color changes to green.

You can start a new game by clicking the "Again" button, which generates a new number and resets the score to 20.

Below the score, your highest score is displayed.

### More info:

This was my first JavaScript project while going through the course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

The "index.html" and "style.css" files were provided by the instructor but all of the code in "script.js" is my own.

Got the game running and then refactored code to make it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
